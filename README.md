web based command line interface

This is a very simple web application running upon mochiweb that can provide terminal
command line interface in a web page.

This is very useful for me to do development and web server management on my remote server
via a web browser at any place and any time. This is especially useful for me to work
in my office where the ssh and telnet is unusable because of the firewall rule.
