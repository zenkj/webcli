web based command line interface

This is a very simple web application running upon mochiweb that can provide terminal
command line interface in a web page.

This is very useful for me to do development job on my remote server and perform remote
server management via a web browser at any place and any time.

This is especially useful for me to work in my office where the ssh and telnet is
unusable because of the firewall rule.

for the file editing, i find the old powerful command line editor *ed* is very useful
and enough for my purpose.
